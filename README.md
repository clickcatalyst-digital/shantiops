# Shanti Ops

Manufacturing operations platform for Shanti Boilers (SLA/milestone tracking, Master BOM Excel
import with department-scoped editing, dispatch/packing), plus a device/browser security platform
(USB/CD/phone blocking + website policy, manager-approved via TOTP). One app, one database.

**→ See [SYSTEM.md](SYSTEM.md) for everything** — features, architecture, roles, data model, known
gaps, and setup. This README is intentionally just the entry point.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Data lives in **Turso** when `TURSO_URL` + `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` are set in `.env.local` (they are);
otherwise it falls back to a local SQLite file. First run auto-seeds demo data.

# Shanti Ops — Manufacturing Operations + Device/Data Security Platform

**This is the single canonical system document.** If you are picking up this project cold (a new
AI session, a new developer, or re-orienting after time away), read this file first — it should
be enough to understand what exists, how it fits together, and where the known gaps are, without
re-deriving anything from the code. Two independent platforms share one app, one database, and one
set of user accounts:

1. **Operations platform** (§1–8) — runs a boiler order from design to commissioning, replaces the
   manual packing list.
2. **Approval / device-security platform** (§9–16) — a Windows agent + browser extension that
   blocks USB drives, CDs/DVDs, phones, and websites on employee machines until a manager approves,
   via the same dashboard.

Everything in this file reflects the **current, working build** as of 2026-07-12 (post final
pre-demo round: multi-project customer logins + "My Orders", role-aware `/help`, self-registration
with an approval hierarchy + new `executive` role, the onboarding roster in Approvals → People, and
extending the audit trail to the operations platform's core mutations — see §16).

---

# Part A — Operations platform

## 1. What it is — an operational command center, not a spreadsheet

Exception-driven and **role-aware**: it surfaces what needs attention and shows each user the right
altitude. Three experiences share one database:

| View | Who | Answers |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Operations** | functional heads, PM | "What needs doing today?" |
| **Executive** | PM | "Where are the risks and when do we ship?" |
| **Customer Portal** | the customer | "How is my order progressing?" |

## 2. Roles & access (department-based)

Three internal roles (PM tier: admin/manager/**executive**, all `isPM()` — see §2a for why a third
PM-tier role exists) plus the external customer, plus a fifth role used only by the security
platform (§9). Access for functional heads is scoped **per department**, not per project — the
single access-scoping unit. A customer is scoped to **one or more projects** (`users.project_ids`
CSV, same idiom as departments) — a company with several orders gets one login and a "My Orders"
landing page (`/portal`), not one login per order.

**Departments:** Design, **Engineering** (owns the Bill of Materials — no milestones of its own),
Procurement, **Stores** (owns the BOM's GRN/receipt columns — also no milestones), Production, QC,
**Dispatch** (owns Packing), Installation.

| Login | Password | Role | Access |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| `admin` | `admin123` | **PM** (`admin`) | Everything — all projects, all departments. Owns project creation. Only role that can register agent machines. |
| `manager` | `manager123` | **PM** (`manager`) | Same as admin for the ops platform; both are "PM" — see `isPM()` in `lib/auth.js`. |
| `executive` | `executive123` | **PM** (`executive`) | Same full surface as admin/manager, plus top of the approval hierarchy — approves Project Manager registrations that a `manager` cannot (see §2a). |
| `design_head` | `design_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Design department only (demo). |
| `engg_head` | `engg_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Engineering department only (demo) — owns the BOM item definitions. |
| `procurement_head` | `procurement_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Procurement department only (demo). |
| `stores_head` | `stores_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Stores department only (demo). |
| `production_head` | `production_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Production department only (demo). Also the employee role for the security platform. |
| `qc_head` | `qc_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | QC department only (demo). |
| `dispatch_head` | `dispatch_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Dispatch department only (demo). |
| `installation_head` | `installation_head123` | **Functional Head** (`operator`) | Installation department only (demo). |
| `asian_brown` | `asian_brown123` | Customer | One order (SB-1018), read-only, business language. |
| `hkm_charitable` | `hkm_charitable123` | Customer | Three orders (SB-1103/04/05) — lands on **My Orders** (`/portal`), one card per project. |
| `virchow_biotech` | `virchow_biotech123` | Customer | One order (STF-IBR-052). |
| *(agent)* | — | `agent` | Not a human login — a machine-scoped JWT issued when a device is registered. See §11. |

New accounts start **`pending`** (self-registered via the login page's "Request access" — see §2a)
and cannot log in — `pending: 1` on `users` — until a PM approves them; the demo accounts above are
all pre-approved (`pending: 0`).

- **PM** creates projects, owns the schedule (planned dates), edits any milestone, uploads BOMs, and
  manages access. Lands on **Executive**. Top nav: **Executive · Operations · Projects ·
  Approvals** — the Departments picker, Settings, theme toggle, and Logout all live in the **cog
  dropdown** (no standalone Packing tab; reached via Departments → Dispatch).
- **Functional Head** does the data entry operators used to. Scoped to their granted department(s):
  they only see/act on milestones in those departments, get a **read-only** Projects list (no
  "+ New Project"), and see **Packing** only if granted **Dispatch**. A head assigned more than one
  department gets **one tab per department in the top nav**. Empty state if unassigned: "No
  departments assigned yet — contact your PM."
- Access is granted by the PM in **Settings → Access Matrix** (heads × departments grid) alongside
  **User Management** (create / deactivate heads). Enforced at the route/API level via
  `requirePM` / `requireDepartment` / `canAccessDepartment` in `lib/auth.js`.
- **The same two roles carry over to the security platform** (§9): PM = approver, operator =
  employee whose machine gets the agent. No separate account system.

## 2a. Onboarding & self-registration

Anyone can request an account from the **login page** ("Request access") — no admin has to create
it first. `POST /api/register` (public route) takes a display name, username, password, and either
**Department Head** (+ which department(s)) or **Project Manager**; the row is inserted with
`pending = 1` and cannot log in (`/api/login` 403s with "awaiting approval") until approved.

**Approval hierarchy** (`canApproveUser` in `lib/auth.js`): `admin`/`executive` approve anyone;
`manager` approves department heads and customers, but **not** another manager or a PM-tier
registration — that's what `executive` is for. Approving/rejecting is audited via the shared
`usb_audit` table (`user_registered` / `user_approved` / `user_rejected`), same as every other
approval category.

**Approvals → People tab** (PM-only, `components/PeoplePanel.jsx`) is where this happens:
- **Pending Registrations** — see the requested role/departments (adjustable before approving),
  Approve or Reject.
- **Onboarding Roster** — closes the gap noted in the old §13: every internal person (not just
  already-enrolled machines) shows with a derived status — online / enrolled-offline / enroll-file-
  sent / no machine yet — and admin/executive can register a machine + download its enroll file
  right there, so approve → register → enroll-file is one screen instead of three.

## 2b. Help — role-aware guide

The **"i" icon** next to the cog (top nav; a plain link on customer portal headers, which have no
Nav) opens **`/help`**. Content is a plain data structure (`components/help-content.jsx` —
`PM_GUIDE`, `HEAD_GUIDES` keyed by department, `CUSTOMER_GUIDE`), rendered as numbered step cards;
adding a new feature later is one entry in the relevant array, no new page. A PM sees a full system
tour (projects → tracker → Master BOM → packing → approvals → onboarding → settings); a head sees
one section per **granted** department (Engineering/Procurement/Stores/Production/etc.); a customer
sees how to read their order.

The once-empty Engineering department view is now a real workspace: the **Master BOM** (§5a) —
Engineering owns the item definitions, and Procurement / Stores / Production each edit only the
columns their department owns. The Operations page shows BOM-owning heads a "Master BOM" card
(projects with missing BOMs or open items) alongside the milestone attention list.

## 3. Operations view (daily execution)

- **Creating a project seeds its full milestone chain** (`createProjectMilestones` in `lib/db.js`,
  called from `POST /api/projects`) with planned dates laid out from the order date (or today) —
  every milestone starts `pending`, no fabricated data. The Milestone Tracker, department tabs, and
  health badge are live from the moment a project exists; the PM adjusts dates/assignees from there.
- **PM** sees *Today's Factory* (everything); a **head** sees *My Work* (their department(s) only).
  Both lead with **summary chips** (overdue / blocked / due-soon counts).
- The Departments picker (PM, in the cog) and department tabs (multi-department head, in the top
  nav) filter this view via `?dept=`.
- **Special case — Dispatch:** picking the Dispatch department renders the **Pending → Ready →
  Dispatched packing board** (`components/DispatchBoard.jsx`) instead of the generic attention
  list, since packing lives entirely under Dispatch.

### Project page — top to bottom

The layout adapts to who's looking:

1. **Row 1 — identity + attention (two columns):** project header (name, status, "why is this
   delayed?" blocker callout, PM/value/updated, Customer-view link) beside **Needs Attention**
   (only the milestones that matter right now, scoped to the viewer's department if they're a head).
2. **Row 2 — Milestone Tracker:** the same component as the Executive dashboard
   (`components/PortfolioDelayTimeline.jsx`), scoped to this one project — its stages as a
   connected, color-coded bar with a today-marker, expandable into a per-stage pill chain (status,
   delay delta, actual dates), cumulative dispatch delay at the end.
3. **Row 3 — department work**, which differs by role:
   - **PM/admin** see an **all-departments tab strip** (underline style,
     `components/ProjectDepartmentTabs.jsx`) — one tab per department, with a red dot on any
     department that has an overdue/blocked milestone.
   - **Functional head** sees their own department(s) as stacked sections (no tabs) — each is a
     `components/DepartmentPanel.jsx`.
   - Each department's panel (`DepartmentPanel`) shows: that department's milestones via
     `MilestoneBoard`/`MilestoneCard` → edit drawer (`MilestoneDrawer`), plus a department-specific
     panel where relevant — **Engineering → Bill of Materials** (`BomPanel`), **Dispatch →
     Packing** (`PackingPanel`, this project's packing lists + generate-from-BOM).
   - **Milestone edit drawer:** PM gets the full editable form (all fields) + a bulk spreadsheet
     grid. **Functional heads get a reduced drawer** — schedule (planned dates) is read-only, with
     two actions: **Start** (stamps actual start) and **Close** (stamps actual end); closing late
     prompts for delay category + reason.

### Status colours

`Not started` (gray) · `On track / In progress` (blue) · `Running late` (amber) · `Blocked` (red) ·
`Closed` (green). Each milestone's colour merges its human status with its deadline automatically
(`lib/sla.js`, `lib/delay.js`).

## 4. Executive view

Order, top to bottom:

1. **KPIs** — projects, healthy, delayed, critical, completed, average delay (days), value in
   progress.
2. **Milestone Tracker** — the portfolio-wide version of the project-page tracker: one row per
   project, stages as a connected bar, today-marker, cumulative delay, expandable per-stage detail.
3. **Top Risks** (worst blocker per project, ranked by dispatch impact) + **Delayed Because** (by
   category), side by side.
4. **Delivery Forecast** — one row per project: Project · Customer · Health · Progress % · Current
   stage · Delay (±days) · Value · Est. Dispatch.

## 5a. Master BOM (PMB) — the department-scoped materials tracker

The client's real workflow lives in hand-made **"Project Master BOM"** Excel workbooks
(`SB-1104-PMB.xlsx`…): one workbook per customer project, one sheet per subsystem (BOILER, ID FAN,
CHIMNEY…), one row per material with procurement lifecycle columns explicitly owned by departments
("by DESIGNS" / "PURCHASE DEPT." / "STORES DEPT." / "PRODUCTION DEPT."). The PMB module imports
those workbooks and replaces the shared spreadsheet:

1. **Import** (Engineering or PM, project page → Engineering panel): upload the `.xlsx` →
   server-side tolerant parse (`lib/pmb.mjs` — keyword header detection handles the several
   hand-made layouts, including two-row headers and split "PO No. | Date" column pairs) → a
   **mandatory preview** (per-sheet counts, ignored columns, skipped rows) → confirm. Nothing is
   written without a human looking at the preview. Re-import is an explicit, destructive
   **Replace** (warns about packing links). The original `.xlsx` is stored whole in `bom_imports`
   — that row *is* the revision record, downloadable via `/api/bom-imports/[id]/file`.
2. **After import the app owns the data** (decided): departments update statuses in the app, no
   Excel re-sync. Assembly-heading rows become `group_label` on the items below them, so every
   `bom_items` row stays a packable item and the packing reconciliation (§5) is untouched.
3. **Field-level department scoping** — the module's trust boundary, enforced in
   `PATCH /api/bom-items/[id]` via `BOM_FIELD_OWNERS` (`lib/bom-fields.mjs`), not just hidden in
   the UI: Engineering (+PM) edit the definitions (description/spec/size/make/qty + add/delete),
   Procurement edits status/PR/PO, Stores edits GRN/quantities/BQ-TC, Production edits
   issued/received. A forged request gets a 403 naming the offending keys.
4. **Views:** one shared `BomTable` (grouped by sheet + assembly, client-side search + status
   filter — the big project has 400+ rows) rendered in the Engineering panel and in the
   Procurement/Stores/Production department panels; `BomProgress` per-section rollup on the
   project page; a **BOM %** column in the Executive Delivery Forecast; a "Master BOM" open-items
   card on Operations for BOM-owning heads.
5. **Audit:** imports, replaces, item adds/edits/deletes all write `usb_audit` rows
   (`bom_import` / `bom_replace` / `bom_item_add` / `bom_item_edit` / `bom_item_delete`) via the
   shared `audit()`.
6. **Parser self-check** (no JS test framework, same precedent as the agent's `--selftest`):
   `node lib/pmb-selfcheck.mjs` (synthetic fixtures) or point it at a real workbook to print
   per-sheet mapping/counts/skips.

Deliberately **not** built (v1 decisions): document management for drawings/IBR/QC certificates,
release/approval workflow for BOM revisions, Excel export/back-sync, in-app BOM authoring from
scratch (the add/edit/delete APIs are 90% of it — natural v2), supplier/lead-time analytics.

## 5. Packing & BOM (the digital packing list)

The Dispatch department board: **Pending → Ready → Dispatched**. BOM-driven flow:

1. **Engineering (or PM) uploads a BOM** — normally the PMB import above; a paste-rows fallback
   (Description, MOC, Size/Spec lines) remains for non-Excel BOMs — via the Engineering panel on
   the project page.
2. **Dispatch generates a draft packing list** from still-pending BOM lines (Engineering tab's BOM,
   or the Dispatch tab's own panel) — `Material description`, `MOC`, `Size/Spec` prefilled;
   `IBR No.`, `Item code`, `Box No.`, `Qty`, `Make` left for the Dispatch head to fill.
3. On approval (status ≥ Ready), rows feed the board.
4. **Reconciliation:** any BOM line not yet on an approved packing list stays **Pending** and can
   seed a new list later (partial dispatch). Each packing item links back via `bom_item_id`.
5. **Real PDF generation** (`@react-pdf/renderer`): "Generate PDF" streams a document matching the
   SB-IBR-1018 layout (company header, buyer/invoice/DC block, item table, 7-day declaration,
   Stores/Production/QC/Management sign-off). A separate **Pending-list PDF** exports unpacked lines.

## 6. Customer Portal (read-only, external)

- **My Orders** (`/portal`) is the landing page for every customer — one card per project they own
  (`users.project_ids` CSV, `canAccessProject()` in `lib/auth.js`), even when they only have one.
  Clicking a card opens the per-order view.
- Business-language **phase stepper** (Order Received → … → Commissioning), overall %, est. dispatch.
- A packing-list link that opens a **read-only document view** (Print / Generate PDF only) — no
  editing, and only once the list is past draft (≥ Ready). Enforced at the route and API level.
- A customer only ever sees their own project(s) — every portal/packing route checks
  `canAccessProject`, never a bare `project_id` equality.

## 7. Operations-platform data model

```
projects ──< milestones                         (flat — design → commissioning, no unit layer)
projects ──< bom_items                           (the Master BOM — §5a)
projects ──< bom_imports                         (one row per PMB upload: revision + the original .xlsx BLOB)
projects ──< packing_lists ──< packing_items     (packing_items.bom_item_id → bom_items, reconciliation)
users (role + departments CSV + project_ids CSV [customer scoping, one-or-more] + pending flag)
```

`bom_items` carries the spreadsheet-mirror columns — `section` (sheet), `group_label` (assembly
heading), `make`, `qty_text`, `purchase_status` (PENDING/TRANSIT/CLOSED/RECEIVED), and free-text
refs `pr_ref`/`po_ref`/`grn_ref`/`grn_qty_text`/`pending_qty_text`/`bqtc_ref`/`issued_ref`/
`received_ref`/`remarks`, plus `import_id → bom_imports` (null = pasted/added in-app). All refs
are deliberately free text (the cells mix numbers, dates and codes); only `purchase_status` is
normalized, and rollups count nothing else.

Milestones carry: assignee, department, planned/actual dates, status, delay category + reason,
vendor/PO/material-ready/QC flags, notes, and a **dormant `depends_on_key`** for a future
dependency/critical-path layer.

## 8. Operations-platform deferred items

Dependency graph / auto critical-path (`depends_on_key` column in place), an **activity feed UI**
(the underlying data now exists — `usb_audit`, §16 — just no page renders it yet), file/photo
uploads (the PMB blob in §5a is the only stored file — there is still no general document store),
barcode/QR validation at dispatch, email/WhatsApp notifications, and the §5a "deliberately not
built" list (drawings/IBR document management, BOM release workflow, Excel export, in-app BOM
authoring, supplier analytics). QC, Installation and Design still just get their milestone list;
Procurement/Stores/Production now also get the Master BOM.

---

# Part B — Approval / device-security platform

## 9. What it is

A separate but integrated system, reached via **Approvals** in the top nav (`/approvals`). It
blocks external devices and websites on an employee's Windows PC by default; the employee's
attempt to use them files a request; a **PM (manager/admin)** approves it with a **TOTP code**
(set up once in Settings) and it unlocks for a time-boxed window (default 15 min). Every
transition is audited. One approval engine, reused across every category below — adding a new
kind of thing to control is mostly configuration, not new code.

Two client pieces run on the employee's machine, both installed by **one installer**:

| Piece | Guards | Technology |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows Agent** (`agent/`) | USB storage, CD/DVD, phones (MTP/WPD) | Python, runs as a background service |
| **Browser Extension** (`extension/`) | Websites, per-domain | Chrome + Edge, Manifest V3 |

The Agent and Extension talk to each other over `127.0.0.1:47113` (localhost only) — the Extension
asks the Agent "is this domain allowed right now?"; the Agent is the only piece that talks to the
cloud dashboard.

**Approvals tab layout** (`app/approvals/page.js`, shadcn Tabs):
- **Devices** (live) — USB/CD/phone requests, whitelist, machine roster.
- **Browser** (live) — website policy, active grants, pending requests.
- **Mail** (placeholder) — see §16 and `docs/v4-zoho-mail-brainstorm.md`.

## 10. Devices — USB, CD/DVD, phones

**State machine** (agent-side, `agent/agent.py`): `BLOCKED` (default, fail-safe) → `PENDING`
(request filed) → `APPROVED` (unlocked until `expires_at`). Any rejection, revocation, expiry, or
device removal snaps back to `BLOCKED`. A **device-swap guard**: while one device is approved, any
*other* device appearing alongside it forces an immediate re-block — the registry-level block is
global, so an unapproved second device can't ride an open window.

**Enforcement is Windows registry policy, not service-disabling** (`agent/backends.py`,
`WindowsBackend`):
- **USB storage**: `USBSTOR` service `Start` value, 4 = blocked / 3 = allowed.
- **CD/DVD**: Removable Storage Access policy keys
  (`HKLM\...\RemovableStorageDevices\{53f56308-...}`) `Deny_Read`/`Deny_Write`, plus `NoCDBurning`
  belt-and-braces. *Not* the `cdrom` service — disabling that kills drive **detection** too, so a
  blocked disc could never be discovered and requested.
- **Phones (MTP/WPD)**: same Removable Storage Access mechanism, but **two** class GUIDs
  (`{6AC27878-...}` and `{F33FDC04-...}`, MTP vs PTP presentation) — both must be denied or some
  phones slip through.
- `block()` blocks **every** channel at once (fail-safe). `unblock(kind)` opens only the approved
  one.
- **Caveat, unconfirmed on real hardware:** Microsoft's own docs say the CD/phone deny may need a
  device or OS restart to take effect. The agent nudges with `pnputil /restart-device` as a
  best-effort mitigation. CI runners have no optical drive or phone, so this can only be confirmed
  on a real Windows machine.

**Device identity** (`lib/usb.js` `normalizeDevice`, boundary-validated): `usb`/`phone` carry real
4-hex-char VID/PID + serial from the descriptor. `cd` has none, so the **server** (not the agent)
assigns the fixed `0000:0000` identity and uses the disc's volume serial number instead.

**Whitelist**: a known-good device (e.g. the company's own USB drive) can be marked whitelisted
(requires TOTP to turn on) — this skips the approval step, not a permission gate; devices are
blocked by default regardless.

**Known gap**: there is no equivalent "always reject" / blocklist for a specific bad device by
serial number — every unknown device becomes a pending request that a PM must notice and reject
manually. The Browser side (§11) already has a real three-state policy (Allow/Block/Approval);
Devices only has two (default-block + optional whitelist-skip). Worth adding a
per-device `blocked` flag mirroring the browser model.

## 11. Browser — per-domain policy

**Policy model** (`approval_policies` table, `kind='browser'`, `target`=normalized domain,
`action` ∈ `allow | block | approval`) — set by a PM in the Blocked Websites section. Domains
match **exact-or-subdomain** (`lib/browser.js` `matchPolicy` server-side, `agent/browser.py`
`match_policy` Python-side — deliberately duplicated, each with its own self-check, since they run
in different runtimes). Most-specific target wins (a rule for `drive.google.com` overrides one for
`google.com`).

**Enforcement**: the Extension's background service worker polls the Agent's `/blocklist`
endpoint and mirrors the result into **declarativeNetRequest dynamic rules** — `||domain^` matches
the domain and every subdomain natively, so **no public-suffix-list logic is needed**. This was a
deliberate choice over `webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate`, which can't block synchronously under
Manifest V3. DNR rules **persist across browser/agent restarts** — if the agent goes down, the
last-known policy stays enforced (fail-safe, never fail-open).

A blocked/approval-pending navigation redirects to the extension's own `blocked.html`, which shows
the domain and, for approval-required domains, a "Request access" button. After a manager
approves, the block page messages the background worker to re-sync immediately (not wait for the
~30–60s periodic alarm) so the unblock lands in ~3 seconds.

**Agent-side** (`agent/browser.py`, `BrowserGuard`): a `ThreadingHTTPServer` on
`127.0.0.1:47113`, entirely separate from the device state machine. Caches the policy list and any
approved grants; local-clock expiry (an expired grant re-blocks on the *next* navigation, not
mid-page — same forward-looking model as devices, not a bug).
Trust ceiling (documented as `ponytail:` in the source): any local process on the machine can read
the policy list or file a request on this port. Acceptable because nothing is granted without
manager TOTP and the machine's cloud JWT never crosses this port. Native messaging (extension ↔
agent via Chrome's own IPC, not localhost) is the upgrade path if that ceiling ever matters.

**Force-install is the only real enforcement.** An unpacked/dev-mode extension can be toggled off
by the employee — it's test-grade only. Real enforcement needs the extension **published** (Chrome
Web Store) and force-installed via registry policy (`ExtensionInstallForcelist`, written by the
installer for both Chrome and Edge — they use separate registry paths, and Edge additionally needs
its "allow extensions from other stores" policy to force-install a Chrome-Web-Store item). See §14.

## 12. Auth boundary for the security platform

- **Dashboard routes** (`/api/usb/*`, `/api/browser/*`) — normal session cookie, `requirePM` /
  operator-scoped, same as the rest of the app.
- **Agent routes** (`/api/agent/*`) — Bearer JWT with `role: 'agent'` + a `machine_id` claim that
  can **only** come from the token (never the request body) — the trust boundary that stops one
  machine from acting as another. `middleware.js` bypasses the cookie check for `/api/agent/*`
  (agents never carry a cookie); the handler does real verification.
- `isAgent()` in `lib/auth.js` explicitly excludes the agent role from `isInternal()`, so a leaked
  agent token can never be pasted into a session cookie and pass as a human PM/operator login.
- **Enroll endpoint** (`/api/agent/enroll`) is the one deliberately **unauthenticated** route (a
  machine has no token yet) — see §13 for how it's still safe.

## 13. Enrollment — zero-typing setup

Registering a machine (`POST /api/usb/machines`, admin-only) creates the machine row **and** a
short single-use enroll code (`enroll_code`, 8-char Crockford base32, no ambiguous characters,
`enroll_expires` = now + 24h). Two ways to redeem it:

1. **Sidecar file (default, zero-typing)**: `GET /api/usb/machines/[id]/enroll-file` downloads a
   tiny `shanti-enroll.json` (`{server_url, enroll_code}`) for that specific machine. The admin
   drops this file — plus the installer — into the employee's Drive folder. The employee downloads
   both into the same folder and double-clicks the installer; it finds the sidecar file next to
   itself, and no dialogs ask for anything.
2. **Manual code entry** (fallback): the installer's wizard asks for the code directly if no
   sidecar is present.

Either way, the agent's first run does `POST /api/agent/enroll {code}` → the code is checked
(`enroll_code=? AND enroll_expires>now AND active=1`) → single-use (cleared on redemption) →
returns a long-lived machine JWT, which is what the agent actually uses from then on. The endpoint
is rate-limited per IP (in-memory token bucket, 10/minute) and every attempt (success or failure)
is audited.

**Leak risk, stated plainly**: whoever holds the sidecar file or the code can enroll one machine
as that employee within the 24h window. Bounded — a freshly enrolled machine can still do nothing
without a manager's TOTP on every subsequent approval, and the machine then shows up in the
Machines list for the PM to notice.

**Gap closed**: the "employee roster" view now exists — Approvals → **People** tab's Onboarding
Roster (§2a) shows every internal person, not just already-enrolled machines, with a derived
status (online / enrolled-offline / enroll-file-sent / no machine yet) and inline register + enroll-
file download.

## 14. Publishing & distribution

- **Windows Agent**: built by CI (`.github/workflows/agent-windows.yml`, `windows-latest` runner)
  via PyInstaller (`--onefile`) into `shanti-agent.exe`, then wrapped by an Inno Setup installer
  (`agent/installer.iss`) into `ShantiAgentSetup.exe`. The same workflow runs `--selftest` (state
  machine, no Windows needed) and `--winselftest` (real registry round-trips — USBSTOR, CD, both
  WPD GUIDs — genuinely only provable on Windows) against both the source and the built exe (catches
  PyInstaller bundling gaps), then does a silent-install smoke test.
- **Browser Extension**: zip `extension/` and upload to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard
  (unlisted visibility is fine) — this is a manual, external step gated on Google's review (days).
  Once published, note the extension ID and set `#define ExtensionId "..."` in `installer.iss`,
  then tag a release — CI rebuilds the installer with the force-install registry keys now active.
  **This step was not done as of this writing** — the extension currently only works loaded
  unpacked (developer mode), which is test-grade, not enforced.
- Full runbook: **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

## 15. Auto-update

- **Extension**: updates for free via the Chrome Web Store's own mechanism once published — no
  code needed.
- **Agent**: self-updates. Every poll, the agent's GET to `/api/agent/requests` returns
  `latest_version` and `update_url` (from the `AGENT_LATEST_VERSION` / `AGENT_UPDATE_URL` env
  vars). If the server's version is newer (`_is_newer`, tuple comparison) and an update URL is
  set, the agent downloads the installer, launches it detached
  (`/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART`), and exits so the installer can overwrite the
  running exe. The installer's `[Run]` step restarts the scheduled task automatically. Devices stay
  in their last-known blocked/allowed state during the few-second gap (registry state persists
  while the agent is down — fail-safe). The installer is update-safe: it never overwrites an
  existing real token with a blank one on re-run.
- **Shipping an update**: bump `__version__` in `agent/agent.py` and `MyAppVersion` in
  `installer.iss` → `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` → CI attaches the new installer to a
  GitHub Release → set `AGENT_LATEST_VERSION` on the server. Every enrolled machine updates itself
  within one poll cycle. No one ever needs physical/remote access to an employee's PC again.
- **No code signing** (decided, for now) — the installer is unsigned, so first run shows Windows'
  "protected your PC → More info → Run anyway" prompt once. Auto-update runs from the SYSTEM
  scheduled task, which mostly avoids SmartScreen. Revisit if a code-signing cert is purchased.

## 16. Approval-platform data model

```
machines (id, name, user_id → users, active, last_seen, agent_version,
          enroll_code, enroll_expires, enrolled_at)
usb_devices (id, vendor_id, product_id, serial, label, kind[usb|cd|phone],
             whitelisted, first_seen, UNIQUE(vendor_id, product_id, serial))
usb_requests (id, machine_id, device_id, status[pending|approved|rejected|revoked, 'expired' derived],
              reason, requested_at, decided_at, decided_by, expires_at)
usb_audit (id, request_id, machine_id, actor, action, detail, created_at)   -- generic, shared by devices AND browser

approval_policies (id, kind, target, action, UNIQUE(kind, target))          -- kind='browser' today; 'application' reserved for future app-control
browser_requests (id, machine_id, domain, status, reason, requested_at,
                   decided_at, decided_by, expires_at)                      -- deliberately a sibling of usb_requests, not a generalization — see below

users.totp_secret / totp_pending_secret / totp_fails / totp_lock_until / totp_last_code
```

**Design note for future contributors**: `usb_requests` and `browser_requests` are two separate
tables, not one generalized `approval_requests(kind, ...)` table. This was a deliberate choice —
the shared logic (`effectiveStatus`, `verifyTotp`, `audit`, lazy expiry) already lives in
`lib/usb.js` as functions that operate on any row shape with the right columns; generalizing the
*table* would have meant rewriting the already-shipped, already-tested device flow for zero
functional gain. `usb_audit` **is** shared/generic (action/detail free text) — reuse it for any
future approval category rather than creating a new audit table per kind.

**This table is now the system-wide audit trail, not just the security platform's.** It also logs
the operations-platform's core mutations — `milestone_edit` (project/key/changed-fields),
`access_matrix_edit` / `user_reactivated` / `user_deactivated`, `project_created`,
`packing_created` / `packing_status_change`, plus the BOM (`bom_import`/`bom_replace`/
`bom_item_edit`/`bom_item_delete`) and people (`user_registered`/`user_approved`/`user_rejected`)
actions from §2a/§5a. **No UI viewer exists yet** — it's queryable (`sqlite3`/Turso CLI) but not
surfaced in the app; add an Activity view once it's clear who needs to read it day-to-day (PM-only
global log? per-project history tab?).

## 17. Approval-platform deferred items

Native messaging (extension↔agent) instead of localhost · code signing · printing, clipboard,
screen-capture control · phones/desktop app-control to block side-installed browsers or messaging
apps · cloud-storage & web-messaging domains (these are just `approval_policies` rows once someone
asks — no new code) · Zoho external-mail approval (brainstorm doc exists, not built — see
`docs/v4-zoho-mail-brainstorm.md`) · the device-blocklist gap in §10 (employee-roster gap in §13 is
now closed — see §2a). TOTP is not required for people approvals (v1) — session + the approval
hierarchy + audit trail was judged sufficient; revisit if that proves too light.

# Part C — Shared architecture & running the app

## 18. Tech stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **React 18**. Server components read data directly; API routes
  handle writes, auth, and PDF generation. PDFs via `@react-pdf/renderer` (pure Node, externalized
  in `next.config.js`).
- **UI: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui** (radix primitives in `components/ui/`). Theme tokens (premium
  palette + status colors) live in `app/globals.css`; dark mode via the `[data-theme="dark"]` toggle
  in `components/Nav.jsx`. Toasts via `sonner` (`showToast` in `lib/client.js` wraps it).
- **Responsive layout:** the content column is defined once — an unlayered `.container` rule in
  `app/globals.css` (centered, `max-width: 1760px`, fluid `clamp` padding) — so it's balanced on a
  1920 monitor (symmetric gutters) and comfortable on mobile. **Mobile is app-like:** desktop
  top-tabs collapse into a fixed **bottom tab bar** (icons) below `md`; tables like Projects render
  as cards on mobile, a table on desktop.
- **Database: Turso (libsql)** via `.env.local`; falls back to a local SQLite file for offline dev.
  Schema = raw `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` DDL in `lib/db.js` `migrate()`, additive changes via
  `addColumn()` (ignores "duplicate column" on re-run).
- **Auth**: bcrypt + JWT in an httpOnly cookie carrying role + granted departments (human users) or
  a Bearer header carrying `role:'agent'` + `machine_id` (the Windows agent). See §12.
- **Windows Agent**: Python 3, stdlib-only HTTP server (no new dependency), `requests` +
  `pywin32`/`wmi` on Windows. PyInstaller for the executable, Inno Setup for the installer.
- **Browser Extension**: vanilla JS, Manifest V3, declarativeNetRequest — no build step, no
  framework.

## 19. Repo layout

`lib/` — db, auth, sla/delay engine, milestone taxonomy, data helpers, formatters, packing-pdf,
`pmb.mjs` (PMB Excel parser + its `pmb-selfcheck.mjs`), `bom-fields.mjs` (BOM field ownership —
pure data, importable client-side), `usb.js` (device approval domain logic, shared primitives),
`browser.js` (domain normalize/match), `enroll.js` (enrollment codes + rate limit).
`app/` — pages + API routes, including `api/agent/*` (Bearer-agent), `api/usb/*` and
`api/browser/*` (session-cookie, PM-gated).
`components/` — nav, project/milestone/packing UI, settings forms, `DevicesPanel` /
`BrowserPanel` / `PeoplePanel` / `TotpSetup` for the Approvals tab, `help-content.jsx` (the
role-aware `/help` guide content — plain data, no CMS).
`components/ui/` — shadcn primitives.
`agent/` — the Python Windows agent, its Inno Setup installer, and its own
[README](agent/README.md) (build/test commands, deeper technical detail than this file).
`extension/` — the Chrome/Edge MV3 browser-policy extension.
`docs/` — [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) (go-live checklist/runbook),
[v4-zoho-mail-brainstorm.md](docs/v4-zoho-mail-brainstorm.md) (future milestone framing),
`Device-Agent-Install-Guide.docx` (non-technical employee install guide).

## 20. Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Demo project **SB-1018** seeds on first run as a single flat 25-stage milestone chain (completed →
an overdue/blocked vendor bottleneck → in progress → upcoming) plus the `PL-1001` packing list, and
the demo logins in §2.

For the security platform on macOS (no Windows machine needed for development):
```bash
python3 agent/agent.py --selftest      # state-machine assertions, no server needed
python3 agent/agent.py --simulate      # exercises the real backend API; edit agent/sim_events.txt
                                        # to fake device insertions, e.g. "0781 5567 SN1 SanDisk"
```
Real Windows-only behavior (registry effects, WPD/CD blocking) can only be verified in CI
(`--winselftest` on the `windows-latest` runner) or on a physical Windows machine.

> Note: don't run `npm run build` (production) against the same working tree while `npm run dev`
> is pointed at it — mixing build output and dev-server output in one `.next` folder corrupts it
> (missing vendor chunks, pages render unstyled). If that happens: stop the dev server,
> `rm -rf .next`, restart.

## 21. If you're an AI picking this project up cold

Read this file, then in this order if you need more: `agent/README.md` for agent build/test
commands, `docs/SETUP.md` for the deployment runbook, then the actual source — `lib/usb.js` and
`lib/browser.js` are the two files that encode almost all of the approval-platform's business
logic and are worth reading in full before touching anything in `app/api/agent/*` or
`app/api/usb/*`/`app/api/browser/*`. Known gaps are listed explicitly in §10, §13, and §17 — don't
rediscover them, just check whether they've since been closed (git log / the API surface) before
assuming they're still open.
